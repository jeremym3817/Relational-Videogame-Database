# Relational-Videogame-Database

This is a proof of concept relation database designed to be compiled in PostgresSQL. It emulates the important entities and constraints videogame distributors and developers may face in their industry.

The design was fleshed out by creating a relational schema to define entities and how they interact with one another. Then using the diagram created, the diagram was converted into a relational schema that models the relationships that define all id joins and entity properties. 

Using these diagrams as guides, creating the tables and populating them allows this data to be manipulated and modified.

The table creation, population, and sample queries/modifications are in this repository for testing purposes.
